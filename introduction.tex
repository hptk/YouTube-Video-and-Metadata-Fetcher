YouTube is without a doubt the world's largest host of user-generated content,
with over one billion users generating several billion
views over hundreds of billions of hours every day ~\cite{officialstats}. Though
there does not seem to be an official source, it is believed that by the end of
2014, more than 300 hours worth of content was being uploaded to YouTube every
minute ~\cite{dagensmediastats}~\cite{reelseostats}.

This makes YouTube a fantastic resource of both videos and metadata to be used
for analysis for a range of different purposes. Our tool aims to aid a group of
users who may not be looking for a particular subset of data, but rather a
large, unbiased sample. Our approach is to let the user create a search query
for a specific timeframe, optionally limiting results further with additional
fields, and querying the YouTube API for every available video within that
timeframe. We deem this to be the easiest way to create an unbiased (or at the
very least nearly so) set of videos using YouTube's API, seeing as YouTube will
not let us create a truly random sample set\footnonemark[3].

We provide the means to: build a large database
of video ID's\footnotemark[1] within a set timeframe; fetch
most metadata\footnotemark[2] for the given videos; fetch the videos
themselves, with a set quality; and connect related data points with a
SQLite database.



\footnotetext[3]{The API seems to have some severe undocumented limitations
regarding what videos it will return for a given query.}
\footnotetext[1]{We fetch as much data as possible within the restraints imposed
on us by the API.}
\footnotetext[2]{We fetch all data associated with a video, as well as its
comment threads and replies. Fetching of related videos has been deliberately
left out - for now at least}
