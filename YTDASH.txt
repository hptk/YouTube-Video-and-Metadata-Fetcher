YouTube's MPD object contains a single Period object inside. This is perhaps the biggest conseptual difference between ISO Dash and YT Dash. The Period object then contains a set of adaptations, which represetns the different ways the media can be presented. These can be both sound and video, in mp4 or webm format//NEEDSOURCE. A given adaptation then contains a set of representations, which represent different qualities of the media. Sound adaptations often only contain one representation, where video adaptations can contain as many as 6 (or more for 4K videos) representations. The Representation contatins information about resolution, bitrate, framerate etc. (see Fig//FIGURE), as well as a BaseURL that points to the actual media file for that specific representation. For a given set of YT videos, not all MPDs will contain all formats and quality options//NEEDSOURCE. This will vary between videos based on initial upload quality/qualities and wether YouTube has done transcoding of the video or not.
