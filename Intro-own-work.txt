\section{Selecting a representative sample of video from YouTube}

TO WRITE: SOME INTRO WHY WE WANT TO GET VIDEOS, WHAT IS OUR AIM
- chosen parameter
- unbiased
- large dataset

Before we present our implementation we want to give a brief summary of different kinds of strategies to receive data from YouTube since
there might be some limitations and choosing a strategy depends on various individual decision criteria.

\subsection{Crawling the YouTube website}
There are some arguments against crawling the YouTube website to receive a sample of videos for our intend.
First of all each video page has only up to 20 videos displayed on the right side. Those are not a representative 
sample, not least because YouTube uses this area to advertise paid content provided by other uploaders but also because they are related videos 
and generated by a recommendation system implemented by YouTube to personalize sets of 
videos based on the user's implicit activity on the website. [reference]
This might influence the crawler's path, generates new data used by the recommendation system again on the crawler's next level and results 
in a highly biased sample of videos.

\subsection{Random generation of video IDs}
Assuming that YouTube uses a modified Base64 encoding for URLs with 11 digits for their video IDs, it makes
it almost impossible to find videos by a random generated ID. For our purpose there is also the limitation that this strategy does not support
requesting videos based on previously chosen parameters.

\subsection{YouTube Data API v3}
YouTube provides an application programming interface (API) for incorporating functions normally executed on the YouTube website, such as searching,
into own applications. [referece]
