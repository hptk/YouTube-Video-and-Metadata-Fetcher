This article presented the YouTube implementation of DASH compared to ISO/IEC 23009-1.
It gave an overview of the YouTube Data API v3, outlined the major limitations of it and also provided some guidelines
on how to bypass these limitations in order to obtain a good sample of YouTube videos for further analyzes. The main decision criteria on
implementing the searching for videos were multi concurrency and maximization of the amount of responded videos while minimizing the quota costs and
requests needed to achieve this.
